Alright Chooms, Jack in.

We’ve got a fat stack of net traffic logs—40,000 records deep, crawling with 25 different data points. IP addresses, ports, protocols, payloads, even some nasty attack signatures. This data’s scraped straight from the digital underworld, spanning from 2020 to late 2023. Our mission? Slice, dice, and clean this intel before feeding it to an AI watchdog.  

### **What’s the gig?**  
💾 **Data Recon** – Scope the dataset, check its vitals, and map out the attack patterns over time.  
🔍 **Deep Dive** – Charts, heatmaps, and distributions to sniff out where the action’s been hottest.  
🛠️ **Data Tuning** – Patch missing values, convert IPs into machine-readable format, and strip out the dead weight.  
🔥 **Data Augmentation** – Boost the attack samples using SMOTE to balance out the dataset (gotta make sure the AI doesn’t go blind to certain threats).  
🚀 **Final Prep** – Standardize and split the data, getting it combat-ready for training.  

Long story short, this is a cyber forensics op. We’re laying the groundwork for a machine-learning sentinel that’ll spot DDoS, intrusions, and malware before they tear through the system. Right now, it’s all about pre-game analysis—actual model training comes later.

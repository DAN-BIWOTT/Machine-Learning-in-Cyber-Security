# ðŸ““ Logbook Protocol  

## ðŸ”¹ The Rundown  
Alright, chummer, hereâ€™s the deal: We gotta keep **one master logbook** where we drop all my intel from **ten tutorial sessions**â€”no need to scatter files like a low-tier decker on a panic run. Each week, the **Canvas hub**â€™s got the specsâ€”charts, graphs, whatever theyâ€™re askinâ€™ for. We pull that data, log it clean, and stack it in the right section.  

## ðŸ”¹ Backup Protocol  
Standard opâ€”**source code gets secured, no exceptions.** Ainâ€™t about losing work; itâ€™s about survival. **Data corruption, system crashes, or some gonk overwriting my hard grind?** Nah, I donâ€™t play those odds.

Stay sharp, stay synced, and we'll make every sessionâ€™s got the **receipts.** ðŸš€
